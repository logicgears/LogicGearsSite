			<h3>Why Choose us while there are Gazillion Web Developers out there?</h3>

			<h4>We Adhere to Standards.</h4>

			<h5>Complying with Web standards can give your Web pages greater visibility in Web searches. 
				The structural information present in compliant documents makes it easy for search engines to access and evaluate the information in those documents, and they get indexed more accurately.
				Standards are written so that old browsers will still understand the basic structure of your documents.
				Accessibility is an important idea behind many web standards, especially HTML.
				Not only does this mean allowing the web to be used by people with disabilities, but also allowing web pages to be understood by people using browsers other than the usual ones
				Because a website may go through several teams of designers during its lifetime, it is important that those people are able to comprehend the code and to edit it easily.
				Writing web pages in accordance with the standards shortens site development time and makes pages easier to maintain. </h5>


			<h4>We Optimize the site so as to load faster.</h4>

			<h5>Speeding up websites is important â€” not just to site owners, but to all Internet users. 
				Faster sites create happy users, according to Google's internal studies that when a site responds slowly, visitors spend less time there. 
				Faster sites improves user experience.</h5>


			<h4>We don't hold control over your domain and hosting.</h4>


			<h5>Domain name establishes your brand and identity on the world wide web.
				It is important that the owner of the site holds control of the domain and hosting.</h5>


			<h4>We configure mail servers for your domain.</h4>


			<h5>Most web developers design the sites and do not configure the mail servers properly. We have seen lot of website owners who still use gmail.com or Hotmail.com while the still have a domain!
				We configure mail servers also we integrate to google apps if required.</h5>


			<h4>We make simple, attractive and aesthetic sites.</h4>

			<h5>We make your site attractive. You can also give us a prototype/mockup of the site and we will be able to design the site according to the mock up, and also make sure it is consistent across different browsers.</h5>


			<h4>We can develop custom web applications.</h4>

			<h5>Depending on your requirement we can design and develop custom web based applications.
				Web applications do not require any specific software to be installed on the client's machine a modern browser is only required. Moreover updates maintenance are easier and faster. After all WEB is the emerging platform for today's applications.
				Web applications can also easily integrate with any other services like facebook, flickr, twitter or your mailbox and can aggregate data from different sources.
				Today most of the website make use of dynamic content which improves the user experience and interactivity with the site. </h5>

			<h4>We provide tools where you can make changes or customize the site yourself.</h4>

			<h5>You can make changes to your site if you need and do not have to depend on anyone to change the content on your site.</h5>
